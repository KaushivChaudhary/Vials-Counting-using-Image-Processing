Vials counting using Image Processing :
Client: One of the leading Pharmaceutical company in India

• Business Problem: The challenge is to design a counting system for syringes and vials that streamlines operations, mitigates
the risk of human error, and ultimately optimizes productivity and accuracy in the process.

• Business Solution: Collected and annotated images using object detection techniques, trained the model with Yolov8, and
deployed it using Flask and Streamlit.

• Business Benefits: Achieved 90-96% accuracy and minimized manual effort by 30%, resulting in cost savings of $1M.

• Technology Stack: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, NLTK,OpenCV, YOLO, Flask/Streamlit for deployment.
